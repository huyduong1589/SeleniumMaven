There is NOTHING I can do to change this. Please see this page for more details.\n\nEasily turn on or off Java, Javascript, Cookies, Animated Images, Flash, Silverlight, Stylesheets, Proxy and Automatic loading of images from the Toolbar without having to open the Options or Plugins dialog! This is great for users that want a easy control over their bandwidth usage, privacy or general browsing security by blocking scripts, cookies or other functionality.\n\nNOTE: The 64 Bit Version of Firefox may not support Java/Silverlight, this has nothing to do with QuickJava and is not a bug in my extension! Please google for more information.\n\nPLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPER COMMENTS BEFORE REPORTING A BUG!\n\nUsage:\nInstall the extension and restart your browser to get the QJ Toolbar icons. Configure the options by right clicking on any visible icon and selecting \"Options\". Customize the toolbar with which buttons you choose and enjoy. It's that simple! There are way more options to play with, for help with those right click any visible icon and select \"Help and FAQ\".\n\n(Note, if you don't know how to customize the toolbar icons google it)\nFF29 removes the Status bar from the bottom, visit http://quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/2014/04/missing-your-addon-bar.html for more information\n\nPlease note that the scope of this extension is NOT as extensive as NoScript, and was not designed to compete with it. This includes whitelisting/blacklisting sites and remembering their settings! If you like NoScript then that's fine and this may not be the extension for you. However this extension is ideal for those who prefer a simpler to use, less invasive interface while still having easier access to the controls.\n\nIf you have problems with it working or have any other comments or suggestions, please visit the support homepage for this extension at: http://quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/\n\nI take great pride in the rating of my extension.

Recently, Selenium IDE has brought a some improvements that will break some test scripts. The good news is that most of the essential breaking changes introduced in Selenium IDE 1.0.10 have been incorporated into the Selenium Expert. This should make your migration task a few clicks affair.\n\nOnce you install the Selenium Expert plugin, an Expert pane will be available in Selenium IDE. Use the Selenium Expert is really simple.\n- First click on the Inspect button to let the Selenium Expert check all the test cases in the current test suite.\n- The suggestions from the Expert will be shown in the Expert pane, nicely grouped by the category of the tip. All commands will also be marked with red i icon.\n- You can check all your test cases to see the affected commands. (Individual control and better navigation will be in the next version).\n- Back up every thing first then select the groups you want to fix automatically.\n- Click Fix to let Selenium Expert apply the changes to the suite. The fixes are NOT undo-able hence the need to backup your tests.\n\nCurrently the following inspections are bundled with the Selenium Expert:-\n\n- Detect and fix Boolean attribute usage\n- Detect and fix non-lowercase style attribute usage\n- Detect unsupported css locators\n\nSee my blog for more details.\n\nAs usual feel free to leave comments, improvements, advise, criticism, problems on my blog at http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/.
